# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/rifky/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms


# To get the default values

# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
# 
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
# 
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
# 
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
# 
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to run a command
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
# 
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
# 
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.

# The following command checks if tmux is installed.
# If tmux is installed, it automatically attaches to an existing tmux session.
# If no tmux session exists, a new one is created.
# If tmux is not installed, it simply starts zsh without tmux.
#
# For this to work properly, you need to make sure that your shell is configured
# for homebrew, so you should have this line:
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# In your ~/.zprofile file
# If you don't have that line, or if the file doesn't exist, run this:
# echo '' >>~/.zprofile && echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile && echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
# 
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native

# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.

# Whether to blur the background when `background-opacity` is less than 1.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * a nonnegative integer specifying the *blur intensity*
#   * `false`, equivalent to a blur intensity of 0
#   * `true`, equivalent to the default blur intensity of 20, which is
#     reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher blur intensities may
#     cause strange rendering and performance issues.
# 
# Supported on macOS and on some Linux desktop environments, including:
# 
#   * KDE Plasma (Wayland and X11)
# 
# Warning: the exact blur intensity is _ignored_ under KDE Plasma, and setting
# this setting to either `true` or any positive blur intensity value would
# achieve the same effect. The reason is that KWin, the window compositor
# powering Plasma, only has one global blur setting and does not allow
# applications to specify individual blur settings.
# 
# To configure KWin's global blur setting, open System Settings and go to
# "Apps & Windows" > "Window Management" > "Desktop Effects" and select the
# "Blur" plugin. If disabled, enable it by ticking the checkbox to the left.
# Then click on the "Configure" button and there will be two sliders that
# allow you to set background blur and noise intensities for all apps,
# including Ghostty.
# 
# All other Linux desktop environments are as of now unsupported. Users may
# need to set environment-specific settings and/or install third-party plugins
# in order to support background blur, as there isn't a unified interface for
# doing so.

# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
